Overview
This project aims to predict weather conditions using time series data. It involves data cleaning, visualization, training a model on historical data, predicting future weather, and evaluating prediction accuracy.

Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
Graph Plotting: Visualizing data trends and patterns using graphs and charts.
Time Series Modeling: Using time series CSV data to train predictive models.
Prediction: Forecasting weather conditions for future dates based on trained models.
Evaluation: Calculating Mean Error (ME) and Mean Square Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy.
Comparison: Analyzing the difference between actual and predicted values.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc. (list any additional libraries)# Weather-Prediction
